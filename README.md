# intermediateML

The testing code I wrote along while I completed Kaggles intermediate machine learning course

Some key concepts I learned in this course were:
1) The difference between numerical and categorical data and how both of these data types are important in training models.
2) How to deal with missing data using imputers and categorical data using one hot encoders.
3) The importance of data cleaning and how to set up all of our data pre-processing tasks into pipelines using scikit-learn.
4) Cross-validation and how I can use it to ensure the accuracy of models
5) Gradient boosting to improve my models using XGBoost, I learned how to tune its various parameters in order to improve accuracy as well as prevent over/under fitting.
6) Learning about data leakage and understanding several real world testcases on how to identify and deal with data leakage before it becomes a problem for a model.
